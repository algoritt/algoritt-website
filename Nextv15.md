Next.js 15 introduces several significant updates and improvements to enhance performance, developer experience, and compatibility with the latest technologies. Below is an extensive overview of the key changes, complete with code snippets to illustrate their application.

**1. React 19 Support**

Next.js 15 aligns with React 19, offering full support for its features. The App Router utilizes React 19 by default, while the Pages Router maintains backward compatibility with React 18, allowing developers to upgrade at their own pace.

_Example: Upgrading React Dependencies_

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

**2. Asynchronous Request APIs**

APIs that rely on runtime information, such as `cookies`, `headers`, and `params`, have transitioned from synchronous to asynchronous. This change enhances performance and prepares for future optimizations.

_Example: Accessing Cookies_

```javascript
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function handler() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const token = cookieStore.get("token");
  // Additional logic
}
```

**3. Revised Caching Behavior**

Caching defaults have been updated to provide more predictable behavior:

- **GET Route Handlers**: No longer cached by default. To enable caching, use the `dynamic` route config option.

  _Example: Enabling Caching for a GET Handler_

  ```javascript
  export const dynamic = "force-static";

  export async function GET() {
    // Handler logic
  }
  ```

- **Client Router Cache**: Page components are not cached by default (`staleTime` is set to 0). Shared layout data and back/forward navigation behaviors remain unchanged.

  _Example: Configuring Client Router Cache_

  ```javascript
  // next.config.js
  module.exports = {
    experimental: {
      staleTimes: {
        dynamic: 30,
      },
    },
  };
  ```

**4. Turbopack Stability**

Turbopack, the new bundler introduced in Next.js, has reached stability in development mode, offering significant performance improvements:

- Up to 76.7% faster local server startup.
- Up to 96.3% faster code updates with Fast Refresh.

_Example: Enabling Turbopack in Development_

```bash
next dev --turbo
```

**5. React Compiler (Experimental)**

The React Compiler is an experimental feature that automatically optimizes code by reducing the need for manual memoization with hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback`. This results in simpler and more maintainable code.

_Example: Enabling React Compiler_

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: true,
  },
};
```

**6. Improved Hydration Error Handling**

Next.js 15 enhances error messages related to hydration, providing clearer insights into issues and suggestions for resolution. This improvement aids in faster debugging and development.

_Example: Hydration Error Message_

```plaintext
Hydration Error: Text content does not match. Server: "Hello" Client: "Hi"
Suggestion: Ensure that the content rendered on the server matches the client.
```

**7. New Form Component**

A new `<Form />` component has been introduced to simplify form handling in Next.js applications. This component streamlines form submissions and integrates seamlessly with server actions.

_Example: Using the New Form Component_

```javascript
import { Form } from "next/form";

export default function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <Form action="/api/contact" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="name" required />
      <input type="email" name="email" required />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

**8. Instrumentation Hook**

Next.js 15 introduces a stable instrumentation hook that allows developers to integrate observability tools for monitoring performance and tracking errors. This feature is essential for maintaining application health in production environments.

_Example: Implementing an Instrumentation Hook_

```javascript
export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === "nodejs") {
    const monitoring = await import("@your-monitoring-tool");
    monitoring.init({
      serviceName: "your-app-name",
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    });
  }
}
```

**9. Self-Hosting Improvements**

Enhancements have been made to facilitate self-hosting Next.js applications:

- **Cache-Control Headers**: Custom `Cache-Control` headers are now respected, providing better control over caching strategies.

- **Automatic Sharp Installation**: The `next start` command now automatically installs `sharp` if it's not present, improving image optimization capabilities.

_Example: Custom Cache-Control Header_

```javascript
export async function GET() {
  const response = new Response("Hello, world!");
  response.headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=3600");
  return response;
}
```

**10. Security Enhancements in Server Actions**

Server Actions have been fortified with:

- **Dead Code Elimination**: Unused server actions are removed during the build process, reducing bundle size and potential attack surfaces.

- **Secure Action IDs**: Non-deterministic IDs are generated for server actions, preventing endpoint guessing and enhancing security.

_Example: Defining a Server Action_

```javascript
export async function myServerAction(data) {
  // Action logic
}
```

These updates in Next.js 15 aim to provide a more robust, efficient, and developer-friendly framework for building React applications.
